## Technology Stack Recommendations

### Backend
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, FastAPI/Flask
- **Node.js**: Express, TypeScript for real-time features
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB for time-series data

### Frontend
- **React** with TypeScript
- **Chart.js** or **TradingView** charting library
- **Material-UI** or **Tailwind CSS**

### Infrastructure
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Redis** for caching and session management
- **WebSocket** for real-time data

## Risk Warnings & Considerations

⚠️ **Important Reminders:**
- Start with paper trading (simulated) before using real money
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose
- Implement robust testing before deploying strategies
- Keep detailed logs for debugging and analysis
- Consider tax implications of automated trading
- Be aware of exchange rate limits and fees

## Success Metrics

- **Phase 1-2**: Successfully collecting and storing real-time data
- **Phase 3-4**: First profitable paper trading strategy
- **Phase 5-6**: Consistent performance across multiple strategies
- **Phase 7+**: Fully automated, monitored, and reliable system
